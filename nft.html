    <center><h3><p class="text" id="text1">What are NFT's<br><br> Non fundgible tokens, also known as nft's are digital assets/tokens. What makes them different from cryptocurrency like bitcoin is that NFT's are unique (only 1 copy) unlike bitcoin which are fungible assets which means it can be replaced with one that is identical to it (like money). As I mentioned before, NFT's are digital assests/tokens; these assests are usually unique works of digital art and other unique digital assets that use blockchain technology to be sold and to keep the digital record of that NFT.  </p></h3></center>

<center><h3><p class="text" id="text2">How are NFT's Made <br><br> In theory anyone can make an NFT. First you'll need a crypto wallet and some of the currency of from the platform that you will use to create your NFT since you will need to pay a fee when minting (creating) your NFT. When you mint your your digital work of art or other assests on the blockchain, it then becomes an NFT and not possible to change or modify to prevent tampering of it. You will then need to choose the tyoe of marketplace than you want to sell your NFT on and they can be sold at a fixed price or at auction. NFT's can be very valuable if the demand is there but it's important to research the process if you are committed to creating them.</p></center></h3>
